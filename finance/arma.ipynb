    "What is a Stock market?\n",
    "The stock market is a marketplace that allows for the seamless exchange of corporate stock purchases and sales. Every Stock Exchange has its own value for the Stock Index. The index is the average value derived by adding up the prices of various equities. This aids in the representation of the entire stock market as well as the forecasting of market movement over time. The stock market can have a significant impact on individuals and the economy as a whole. As a result, effectively predicting stock trends can reduce the risk of loss while increasing profit.\n",
    "We will use the ARIMA model to forecast the stock price of ARCH CAPITAL GROUP in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is ARIMA?\n",
    "Before working with non-stationary data, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model converts it to stationary data. One of the most widely used models for predicting linear time series data is this one.\n",
    "\n",

    "These two values, A and B (A’s previous value), are now linked in such a way that A’s current value is predicated on A’s previous value. As a result, any future value for A will be determined by its current value.\n",

    "So, how should this relationship be represented? We create an ARIMA model based on the data. Let’s take a look at you one by one.\n",
